## Creating content exercise

Hi, I'm Levi Trejo aka Trejdon.

I craft user experiences on the internet.

I'm an inquistive problem solver specializing in developing Javascript and React, with a keen interest in mastering CSS, Typescript, and DevOps.

Currently, I'm working for myself to become a healthier person and a vastly more capable developer.

## Taking the content and making some markup to contain it

### My first attempt
<div>
  <h2>Hi, I'm Levi Trejo aka Trejdon.</h2>
  <h5>I craft user experiences on the internet.</h5>
